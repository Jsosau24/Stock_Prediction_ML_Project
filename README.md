# Stock Prediction ML Project
In this project I used the data from 5 differnt stocks (Apple[AAPL], Meta[META], Nike[NKE], SMP500[^GSPC], Vangurad Index Foun[VOO]), after that I ran 4 differnt ML models, there are: Linear Regression, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Random Forest. At the end , I compared the  MAE, MSE, and RMSE to measure the performance of each model
